# Title: Why Electron is Still a Great Choice in 2026

**Intro:**
- "JavaScript is eating the world"
- The debate: native vs. web tech for desktop apps.
- Common complaints about Electron (RAM, performance).
- My argument: for most apps, the benefits *far* outweigh the costs.

**Point 1: Speed of Development**
- One codebase: web, Windows, Mac, Linux.
- Using existing React/Vue/Svelte skills.
- Huge ecosystem (npm).

**Point 2: The "Performance" Argument**
- Computers are faster now. RAM is cheap.
- Is it *really* slow? (VS Code, Slack, Figma - all Electron apps).
- The "slowness" is often bad code, not the platform.

**Conclusion:**
- Don't discount Electron. It allows small teams and solo devs to build powerful, cross-platform apps.
- The trade-offs are known and, for most, perfectly acceptable.
